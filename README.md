Calculating voting tallies and financial records

## Financial Analysis for budgeting

PyBudget will read a given CSV file from the resources folder named budget_path.
Once that file is in place, this program will output:
the number of months in the data, the new profit, the average profits change, and when the greatest profit/loss occur along with the associated values.

## Election Results 

PyPoll will take a file named election_data.csv and loop through it to calculate the winner of an election.
The program will also output: total number of votes, candidates with any votes cast for them, the total amount of those votes and their percent of the total votes, along with the winner of the election
